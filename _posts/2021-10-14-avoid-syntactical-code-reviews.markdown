Some notes on this post:
- Document some tendencies on how a PR can be easily be turned into a code-style check or any other static analysis equivalent
- Prove with a small example how a well structured, clean code, best practices code can still fail a PR if not fully understood (the lazy AND example is a good one)
- Add some mention to security and performance (String leaks etc.)
- Wrap up with some bibliography or posts to read
