# Amin Abu-Taleb Home Page

![Amin Abu-Taleb Home Page Screenshot](/assets/images/screenshots/aabutaleb-homepage-screenshot.png)

Initially based on @rosario's ![Kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper) I reused some of the customizations from @ybrickman's ![Homepage](https://github.com/brikis98/yevgeniy-brikman-homepage) which make a slick multi-purpose homepage that can host my blog as well as my project portfolio.

Feel free to Fork and PR!
